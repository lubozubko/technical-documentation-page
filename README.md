##Technical Documentation Page

One page project using HTML and CSS, created for [freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Projects](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page/) curriculum. This time I have just replicated the example pen, as a practice to test myself.
